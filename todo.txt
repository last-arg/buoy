General:
[ ] Remove/Replace xlib functions if possible: XStringToKeysym
[ ] Try to combine functions getWindowGeometryInside and inBoundsWindowGeometry.
[ ] Convert enums to int (@enumToInt)
[*] Code that deals with placing window into another screen should be good candidate for
function.


Screen:
[*] Convert screens variable from LinkedList to ArrayList
[ ] A screen is added/remove.
[?] Create 'root' window for every screen. Will help with screen switching using enter event.


Group:
[?] Group is moved to another screen. Take into account if any window edges are touching tiling edge. ???


Change window:
[?] Windows' scan area. Trapezoid with triangle(inside window).
[ ] Add multi-color border. Use xcb_create_gc.
[ ] Screen A has no windows but is the active screen. So if you try to move to another window it should search closest window on another screen. Use screen mid point as src point.


Debugging:
[ ] Move debug functions to its own file. 


Move windows:
{y,u,b,n,g} 
  [ ] Place windows into corners/middle.
  [ ] Restore window dimesions and position if window alread in corner/middle
Shift + {y,u,b,n,g} 
  [?] Place window into corner and change window's dimensions to half of screen's available width and height.
{h,j,k,l} 
  [*] Move window certain amount. 
  [*] Base on pixels. 
  [?] Amount based on tile width or height divided by some number.
Shift + {h,j,k,l} 
  [*] Move window to the next closest grid line/border. 
  [?] Use window middle point as anchor instead top-left. Middle anchor will cause difficulties with resizing window.
